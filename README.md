# LinuxCommands

screen - Start a new terminal session that runs in the background even after you log out.
The screen command is a terminal multiplexer in Linux. It allows you to start a new terminal session that runs in the background even after you log out. This means you can start a long-running task in a screen session, log out, and then log back in later to resume the session exactly where you left off.

cron - Schedule tasks to run automatically in the background.
The cron command is a tool in Linux for scheduling tasks to run automatically in the background. It's often used to run scripts, perform backups, update databases, or perform other routine tasks.

watch - Execute a command repeatedly and display the output in real-time.
The watch command in Linux is used to execute a command repeatedly and display the output in real-time. The output is updated every two seconds by default, but you can specify a different interval with the -n option.

tee - Redirect output to both the screen and a file.
"tee" is a command in Unix-like operating systems that is used to redirect output from a command to both the screen and a file. It acts as a "T-shaped" pipe that splits the output of a command into two separate streams, with one stream going to the standard output (e.g. the terminal screen) and the other being written to a file.

xargs - Execute a command multiple times, with different arguments from a list.
xargs is a Unix utility that is used to build and execute commands from standard input. It is often used in combination with other Unix commands such as find, grep, and sed to perform complex operations on large sets of data.

alias - Create a custom alias for a command.
The alias command in Unix-like systems is used to create a short and memorable name for a frequently used command or a series of commands. It allows you to assign a new name to a command, which you can then use as a shorthand for the original command.

cal - Display a calendar in the terminal.
The cal command is a utility in Unix-like systems that is used to display a calendar. It provides a visual representation of the current month or a specified month and year, and can be useful for scheduling and organizing tasks.

du - Display the disk usage of a directory and its subdirectories.
The du command is a Unix-like utility that is used to estimate the space used by a file or directory on a file system. It provides information about the disk usage of files and directories, including the size of the file or directory and the space occupied by the contents of the directory.

uname - Display system information, such as the Linux version and architecture.
The uname command is a utility in Unix-like systems that provides information about the system and the operating system.

whois - Look up information about a domain name or IP address.
